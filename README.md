Humanize Software Labs - Starter Website (Next.js + Tailwind + Sanity schema)

Contents:
- Next.js scaffold (pages, components, styles)
- Basic Tailwind setup files
- Sanity schema examples in /sanity-schemas

How to run locally:
1. Ensure Node.js (LTS) is installed.
2. In project root, run: npm install
3. For Tailwind: follow steps in README under 'Tailwind setup' (or run the commands listed).
4. Run dev server: npm run dev (http://localhost:3000)

Note: This is a starter scaffold. You still need to initialize a Sanity studio separately (see /sanity-schemas for example schemas).
